Python bindings for the fabulous libwkhtmltox using Cython

Special thanks to antialize for creating wkhtmltopdf: http://github.com/antialize/wkhtmltopdf


Tested on:
 * Mac OSX 10.6.4 Snow Leopard, Python 2.6.1 (32-bit and 64-bit)
 * CentOS 5.5, Python 2.6.4 (32-bit)


Pre-requisites on all platforms:
--------------------------------
 * you need libwkhtmltox.* somewhere in your LD path (/usr/local/lib)
 * you need the directory src/include/wkhtmltox from wkhtmltopdf somewhere on your include path (/usr/local/include)


Notes on compiling for Mac OSX 10.6.4 Snow Leopard (64-bit Python/libwkhtmltox only):
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * until this bug is fixed (http://bugreports.qt.nokia.com/browse/QTBUG-5952) you need qt_menu.nib directory from the QT source tree in the same directory as your libwkhtmltox.* libs


Cython
------
 * you need Cython (tested with 0.13, $ easy_install cython) if you want to re-generate C source


Installation
------------
$ python setup.py install
